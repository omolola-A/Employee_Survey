## Introduction

A healthy work environment and an assessment of the health of the organization can be achieved through the use of employee engagement surveys. In this investigation, I use Excel for data exploration and visualization as I examine survey responses from Pierce County, Washington. Using more than 14,000 records, our objective is to find practical insights that promote increases in organizational effectiveness and employee happiness. Come along as we utilize the power of Excel to identify trends, patterns, and chances for constructive change in the workforce.

## Data Source
The dataset was given by Digitaley Drive, to test my knowledge of Data Analysis, after completing data Bootcamp with them.

## Problem Statement
The analysis is to answer the following business questions:

1. Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?
2. Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?
3. As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

## Method of Analysis
1. Data preparation and importation:
  - Launch Excel and import the dataset from the employee survey.
    Check the data for mistakes, duplications, and missing numbers to confirm its accuracy.
  - Using a structured manner, arrange the data so that each column represents a specific survey question or piece of demographic information.

2. Analyzing exploratory data (EDA):
- Analyze exploratory data to learn more about the general distribution of answers.
- Make scatter plots, box plots, or histograms to see the correlations and distribution of the variables.

3. Analysis of Agreement and Disagreement:
- Determine the rates of agreement and disagreement for every survey item.
- To get the proportion of "Agree" and "Disagree" responses, utilize Excel tools like COUNTIF and AVERAGEIF.
- For each question, make bar charts or bar charts to show the rates of agreement and disagreement.

4. Department or Role Analysis:
   - The data by department was grouped to identify any patterns or trends.

5. Identify Areas for Improvement:
   - The survey results were analyzed to identify areas where employee satisfaction may be low.
   - Created charts to visualize key factors influencing employee satisfaction, such as workload, communication, or career growth opportunities.

6. Visualization and Reporting:
   - Create visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate key findings.
   - Utilize Excel features such as conditional formatting, sparklines, and slicers to enhance the visual presentation of the data.
   - Prepare a concise report summarizing the analysis findings, insights, and recommendations for improving employee satisfaction

## Visualisation and Analysis
The report contains a single dashboard that answers the problem statements stated above.

## Findings

- Based on the analysis conducted in Excel, the survey question with the highest agreement rates among respondents is "I know what is expected of me at work", which is question 1 of the 
  survey question, followed by "At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day", question 4, and then "This last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn & 
  grow" the question 9.
  These findings suggest that employees feel confident in understanding their roles and responsibilities, as well as having opportunities for utilizing their strengths and personal 
  development within the organization.

- On the other hand, the survey question with the highest disagreement rate is "I have a best friend at work", question 6, followed by "In the last seven days, I have received 
  recognition or praise for doing good work", question 3, then "My supervisor holds employees accountable for performance", question 8.
  These findings indicate potential areas of concern or dissatisfaction among employees, such as lacking close relationships with coworkers, insufficient recognition for their efforts, 
  and perceived issues with accountability from supervisors.

- It can also be seen that there is a higher agreement rate than disagreement rate for question 10: "Overall I am satisfied with my job", which stands for overall satisfaction of 
  the employees across all departments, we can infer a generally positive sentiment among employees regarding their job satisfaction.

- Based on the survey questions with high disagreement rates, indicating areas of potential concern or dissatisfaction among employees, here are several steps that an employer could 
  consider to improve employee satisfaction:

  1. Foster Positive Work Relationships: Encourage team-building activities and initiatives to help employees build stronger connections and friendships at work, addressing the lack of 
     a "best friend at work" as indicated by the survey. Also, Implement mentorship programs or buddy systems to facilitate peer support and collaboration among employees.

  2. Recognition and Appreciation Programs: Establish formal recognition and appreciation programs to acknowledge and celebrate employee achievements and contributions, addressing the 
     perceived lack of recognition for good work and also encourage a culture of appreciation where managers and peers regularly express gratitude and praise for each other's efforts.

  3. Leadership Development and Accountability: Provide training and development opportunities for supervisors and managers to improve their leadership skills and effectively hold 
     employees accountable for performance, addressing concerns about supervisor accountability. Implement performance management systems that set clear expectations, provide regular 
     feedback, and hold employees and supervisors accountable for meeting goals and objectives.

  4. Improve Communication and Feedback Channels: Enhance communication channels to ensure that employees receive timely and relevant information about organizational changes, goals, 
     and decisions.
  5. Provide opportunities for career advancement, skill development, and professional growth to address the perceived lack of opportunities for learning and growth at work.
     Offer training programs, workshops, and mentorship opportunities to help employees develop new skills and advance in their careers within the organization.
