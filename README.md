## Introduction

A healthy work environment and an assessment of the health of the organization can be achieved through the use of employee engagement surveys. In this investigation, we use Excel for data exploration and visualization as we examine survey responses from Pierce County, Washington. Using more than 14,000 records, our objective is to find practical insights that promote increases in organizational effectiveness and employee happiness. Come along as we utilize the power of Excel to identify trends, patterns, and chances for constructive change in the workforce.

## Data Source
The dataset was given by Digitaley Drive, to test my knowledge of Data Analysis, after completing data Bootcamp with them.

## Problem Statement
The analysis is to answer the following business questions:

1. Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?
2. Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?
3. As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

## Method of Analysis
1. Data preparation and importation:
  - Launch Excel and import the dataset from the employee survey.
    Check the data for mistakes, duplications, and missing numbers to confirm its accuracy.
  - Using a structured manner, arrange the data so that each column represents a specific survey question or piece of demographic information.

2. Analyzing exploratory data (EDA):
- Analyze exploratory data to learn more about the general distribution of answers.
- Make scatter plots, box plots, or histograms to see the correlations and distribution of the variables.

3. Analysis of Agreement and Disagreement:
- Determine the rates of agreement and disagreement for every survey item.
- To get the proportion of "Agree" and "Disagree" responses, utilize Excel tools like COUNTIF and AVERAGEIF.
- For each question, make bar charts or bar charts to show the rates of agreement and disagreement.

4. Department or Role Analysis:
   - The data by department was grouped to identify any patterns or trends.

5. Identify Areas for Improvement:
   - The survey results were analyzed to identify areas where employee satisfaction may be low.
   - Created charts to visualize key factors influencing employee satisfaction, such as workload, communication, or career growth opportunities.

6. Visualization and Reporting:
   - Create visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards to communicate key findings.
   - Utilize Excel features such as conditional formatting, sparklines, and slicers to enhance the visual presentation of the data.
   - Prepare a concise report summarizing the analysis findings, insights, and recommendations for improving employee satisfaction

## Visualisation and Analysis
The report contains a single dashboard that answers the problem statements stated above.
